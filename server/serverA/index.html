                The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed,<br>
                collaborative, hypermedia information systems.<br>
                HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access.<br>
                For example, by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.<br>
                HTTP was developed to facilitate hypertext and the World Wide Web.<br>
                The primary function of a web server is to store, process, and deliver web pages to<br>
                clients. The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext<br>
                Transfer Protocol (HTTP).<br>
                Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include images,<br>
                style sheets, and scripts in addition to the text content.<br>
                Multiple web servers may be used for a high-traffic website.<br>
                A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by<br>
                requesting a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of<br>
                that resource or an error message if unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file<br>
                on the serverâ€™s secondary storage, but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how<br>
                the webserver is implemented.<br>
                While the primary function is to serve content, full implementation of HTTP also<br>
                includes ways of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submitting web<br>
                forms, including the uploading of files.<br>
